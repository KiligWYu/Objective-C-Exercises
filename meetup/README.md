# Meetup

Calculate the date of meetups.

Typically meetups happen on the same day of the week.  In this exercise, you
will take a description of a meetup date, and return the actual meetup date.

Examples of general descriptions are:

- The first Monday of January 2017
- The third Tuesday of January 2017
- The wednesteenth of January 2017
- The last Thursday of January 2017

The descriptors you are expected to parse are:
first, second, third, fourth, fifth, last, monteenth, tuesteenth, wednesteenth,
thursteenth, friteenth, saturteenth, sunteenth

Note that "monteenth", "tuesteenth", etc are all made up words. There was a
meetup whose members realized that there are exactly 7 numbered days in a month
that end in '-teenth'. Therefore, one is guaranteed that each day of the week
(Monday, Tuesday, ...) will have exactly one date that is named with '-teenth'
in every month.

Given examples of a meetup dates, each containing a month, day, year, and
descriptor calculate the date of the actual meetup.  For example, if given
"The first Monday of January 2017", the correct meetup date is 2017/1/2.

## Setup

There are two different methods of getting set up to run the tests with Objective-C:

- Create an Xcode project with a test target which will run the tests.
- Use the ruby gem `objc` as a test runner utility.

Both are described in more detail here: http://exercism.io/languages/objective-c

### Submitting Exercises

When submitting an exercise, make sure your solution file is in the same directory as the test code.

The submit command will look something like:

```shell
exercism submit <path-to-exercism-workspace>/objective-c/meetup/Meetup.m
```

You can find the Exercism workspace by running `exercism debug` and looking for the line beginning
with Workspace.
